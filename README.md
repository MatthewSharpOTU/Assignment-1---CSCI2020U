The program will be able to determine whether an email is detected as a spam message or a legitimate message (denoted by the phrase "ham"). The program will first train to analyze which emails are spam or ham from respective predefined lists that the user inputs as a relative path. Common words and phrases in these documents will be labelled as spam or ham, for the program to then identify whether an email in the testing phase is a spam or ham message. The program will then output the spam probabilty of each message in a list of emails and then display the accuracy (percentage of correct guesses) and precision (ratio to correct positive to spam guesses).
